# Project 

This is a multi-function math parser that I am working on. It is currently in its early stages, but I hope to develop it into a fully fledged equation solver.

## To Do
    Add nested absolute value support
    Add sorting algorithm to sort into machine-readable code (Reverse Polish Notation)
